• Game Name
	NYCTOPHOBIA

• Game Idea (short description)
	The player has to make it out of the forest maze in the dark. They only have a candle and a lighter
	on them with limited fuel. They have to make it out of the maze before they become consumed by the darkness.
	There will be NPCs that will be in different areas of the forest who will help guide the player out of
	the maze with hints in the form of riddles. Since the forest is very windy, the candle will lose its flame
	and it is up to the player to make sure the candle stays lit. If the player is in complete darkness, they
	will start to lose sanity. If their sanity reaches 0, the game is over. To win the game, you need to make it
	out of the forest maze.

	- The game will be a 2-dimensional game with an overhead view. (Similar to old version of Pokemon or Legend
	  of Zelda or even Undertale and Earthbound.)
	- Genre:
		• Survival Horror (but not really horror? more like just psychological horror when you lose sanity?)
		• Puzzle
		• Strategy (in the sense that you have to plan out when you
	  	           relight your candle in sacrifice of your time,
			   or don't relight your candle to sacrifice
	 		   your vision but to save your fuel.)
	
	- The theme will be a mix of horror, puzzle and strategy in the sense that you have to plan out when you
	  relight your candle in sacrifice of your time, or don't relight your candle to sacrifice your vision
	  but to save fuel.
	- Think of Don't Starve Together for the surviving in the dark aspect.

	I also think it'd be smart have landmarks (like a giant tree or even a tree stump or something) to somewhat
	guide the player.

• Scenario and characters description (include placeholder graphics, drafts, references)
	- Scenario:
		•
	- Characters:
		• Sky
			- Protagonist
			- Genderless
			- Purple Shirt with Blue Jeans
			- Child-like?
			- Mute, has no dialogue options only to listen to NPCs.
		• Character Name (TBD)
			- NPC 1
			- This one could possibly give more fuel if the riddle is guessed correctly
		• Character Name (TBD)
			- NPC 2
			- This one could give a hint on how to get out (like indicate where a landmark is and go
			  from there?)
		• Character Name (TBD)
			- NPC 3
			- This one could heal your sanity if you rest with them for a bit, I was thinking they could
			  read you a story or something.

	I believe more NPCs can be added but this is just a general idea for now!

• Game Win/Lose conditions
	- Win:
		• You reach the end of the maze.
	- Lose:
		• You lose all your sanity in the dark.

• Progression of levels
	- I don't think there's really levels, but maybe a possible inclusion to the game is objectives so the game
	  is replayable. Like let's say you need to collect a certain object in the maze and escape with it to get
	  a star at the end of the game. To get another star you'd need to do something else on top of that.
	- Maybe you can have a rating at the end of the game on all the tasks you were able to complete while escaping?

• Sources of inspiration (other games, movies, etc that inspired your idea)
	- Don't Starve Together
	- Slenderman
	- Undertale (for the artstyle and NPC communication?)

• What skills/interests you are looking for in a team mate

	- Someone who is creative
	- Someone who doesn't procrastinate
	- Someone who has an open mind
